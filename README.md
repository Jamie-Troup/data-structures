A collection of data structure C++ implementations - made for my enjoyment and to understand them better

--Stack & Queue

Pretty self explanatory

-- Binary Tree

This actually only makes complete binary trees. Not a search tree, order of nodes doesn't matter, and no balancing involved on insertions or deletions, so you could trim the tree into a linked list. As always, I coded these for fun and didn't focus on making the most efficient implementations, but that might be a fun future project.

The print() function in the binary tree is neat, you need an install of SFML but it can visualise the binary tree for you - so you can make sure your delete/insert operations make sense. Right now I set it to only work for chars and is a POC, just a neat feature to use SFML in a handy way. Image below.

-- Additions in the future

Write up some more exotic trees -> splay trees, treaps, B trees, any balanced ones, threaded binary trees

As I go through this DSA textbook, add any structures I find interesting to build up a lil C++ toolkit
